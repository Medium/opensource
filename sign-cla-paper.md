Sign the CLA: Dead Tree Edition
================================

Even though we at A Medium Corporation would love to leave the
paper world behind, various jurisdictions require that we also accept
physically signed documents. If you wish to take advantage of this
when signing the CLA, then all you need to do is mail us a document
with the following content:

```
[date]

I hereby agree to the terms of the attached Contributors
License Agreement.

I furthermore declare that I am free and able to make this agreement
and sign this declaration.

Signed,
[your signature]

[your name]
https://github.com/[your github userid]
[your email address]
[your address]
[your phone number]
```

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

* `[date]` with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `[your signature]` with your signature.
* `[your name]` with your name (printed).
* `[your github userid]` with your GitHub userid.
* `[your email address]` with an email address at which you can be
  contacted.
* `[your address]` with a physical mailing address at which you can be
  contacted.
* `[your phone number]` with a phone number at which you can be contacted.

Print out a copy of [the CLA](cla-2.0.md), sign and date that copy,
and attach it to the page described above.

Send it all to:

    A Medium Corporation
    Attention: Open Sourceror
    760 Market Street Suite 900
    San Francisco CA 94102
