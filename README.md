Note to External Contributors
-----------------------------

Hello, External Person!

We at Medium are eager to work with you. In order for us to accept patches from you, you will have to
electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
  the open source license of the project that you’re contributing to.

* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we don’t “taint”
the projects we manage with contributions that turn out to be improper. This protects
everyone who wants to use the projects, including *you*! If you want a longer explanation,
then you can check out the [CLA Rationale page](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/cla-rationale.md).

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”), we will then be able to
merge your contributions with a clear conscience and with only the friction that results
from the usual technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the
[Sign the CLA](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/sign-cla.md)
page.

For reference, projects managed by A Medium
Corporation include some using
[MIT License](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/mit-license.md)
with a small clarifying preamble and some using
the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/apache-license-2.0.md).

In addition to our CLA, we have a policy where we avoid owning code that we don’t intend
to maintain through use. If your patch is not in-line with our intended use case
at Medium we will not merge it into any of our trees. But don't be discouraged! If
that’s the case, we encourage you to run your own fork. Email us with a link to it
and we will consider linking to it from the main repo.

If you have any questions about any of this, please raise them by
filing a bug on this project, since there’s a good chance that if you
have a question then someone else has the same question too. If it is
really and truly a private matter, then you can mail Medium’s
official Open Source or privately, at
[open-source@medium.com](mailto:open-source@medium.com).

Thanks, and happy hacking!

Cheers,

Your friends at A Medium Corporation
