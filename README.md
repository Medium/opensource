Note to External Contributors
-----------------------------

Hello, External Person!

We at Obvious are eager to work with you. In order to do so, though,
we have to ask you to jump through a little hoop.

What you have to do is electronically sign a statement that indicates
two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
  the open source license of the project that you're contributing to.

* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible,
that we don't "taint" the projects with contributions that turn
out to be improper.

Once you sign the Obvious Contributor License Agreement (the "OCLA"),
we will then be able to merge your contributions with a clear
conscience and with only the friction that results from the usual
technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the
[Sign the OCLA](sign-ocla.md) page.

For reference, the standard open source license used by The Obvious
Corporation is the [Apache License 2.0](apache-license-2.0.md) with
a small clarifying preamble.

If you have any questions about any of this, please raise them by
filing a bug on this project, since there's a good chance that if you
have a question then someone else has the same question too. If it is
really and truly a private matter, then you can mail [Dan
Bornstein](danfuzz@obvious.com), who is Obvious's official "open
sourceror".

Thanks, and happy hacking!

Cheers,
Your friends at The Obvious Corporation
